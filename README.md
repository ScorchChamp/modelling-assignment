# Modeling Assignment: Sales Prediction and Analysis

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing sales data to understand the impact of various factors such as product quality, market size, and pricing on product sales. We employ statistical modeling and regression analysis to uncover insights and predict sales outcomes.

## Objectives
- Convert categorical variables into dummy variables and identify reference categories.
- Remove missing values and prepare the dataset for regression analysis.
- Use regression modeling to assess the impact of various factors on sales.
- Identify and handle outliers in the dataset.
- Impute missing values appropriately for both continuous and categorical variables.
- Examine potential issues with multicollinearity and address them.
- Investigate non-linear relationships in the data and apply necessary transformations.
- Interpret the outcomes of the regression model and understand the impact of each variable on product sales.
- Explore the debate on the relative importance of price vs. market size on sales using regression analysis.
- Predict sales for a new product based on the developed model.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: Involved converting categorical variables into dummy variables, removing missing values, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Regression Analysis**: A single model including all independent variables was run to assess their impact on sales.
3. **Outlier Handling**: Utilized Cook's D to identify outliers and treated them appropriately.
4. **Missing Value Imputation**: Applied different imputation techniques for continuous and categorical variables.
5. **Multicollinearity Check**: Examined the dataset for multicollinearity issues and addressed them as needed.
6. **Model Improvement**: Investigated non-linear relationships and applied transformations to improve model fit.
7. **Model Interpretation**: Analyzed the regression model's outcomes to deduce the effects of different variables on sales.
8. **Debate Resolution**: Used regression techniques to explore the impact of price vs. market size on sales.
9. **Sales Prediction**: Predicted sales for a new product based on the regression model.

## Key Findings
- **Variable Impact**: The analysis revealed significant insights into how different factors such as discount duration, market size, and product category affect sales.
- **Outliers and Missing Values**: Outliers were identified and handled, and missing values were imputed to ensure the robustness of the regression model.
- **Multicollinearity**: The dataset exhibited minimal multicollinearity, which did not necessitate the removal of any variables.
- **Non-linear Relationships**: Certain variables showed non-linear relationships with sales, and transformations improved the model's fit.
- **Price vs. Market Size**: Market size was found to have a more substantial impact on sales compared to price, resolving the management debate.
- **Sales Prediction**: The model predicted sales for a new product with a reasonable level of accuracy, demonstrating its practical utility.
